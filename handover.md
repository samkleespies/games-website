# Space Asteroids Game - Project Handover

## Project Overview
This is a **Space Asteroids game** built in **Godot 4.4.1** located in the `test-game` directory. The game is a classic arcade-style space shooter where the player controls a ship that shoots asteroids.

## Current Status: PARTIALLY WORKING ‚ö†Ô∏è

### ‚úÖ What's Working:
- Game runs without errors in Godot
- Player ship spawns and is controllable
- Mouse aiming system (ship points where mouse cursor is)
- WASD movement controls
- Left-click and spacebar shooting
- Asteroid spawning system (confirmed via debug - asteroids ARE being created)
- Score system and UI
- Game over/restart functionality
- Background starfield with particle effects

### üêõ Current Critical Issue:
**ASTEROIDS ARE NOT VISIBLE** - This is the main problem right now. The debug output confirms asteroids are being spawned successfully (they appear in the scene tree and container), but they're not visible on screen. This was previously fixed by changing containers from `Node` to `Node2D`, but the issue persists.

### üöß Current Task in Progress:
Implementing a **pause menu system** with:
- ESC key to open/close pause menu
- Resume button
- Options menu with display settings:
  - Windowed/Borderless Fullscreen/Exclusive Fullscreen
  - Resolution selection (1152x648, 1280x720, 1920x1080, 2560x1440, 3840x2160)
- Exit game button

## File Structure

### Core Game Files:
```
test-game/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Main.tscn/.gd           # Main game scene and logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Player.tscn/.gd         # Player ship (triangle sprite, movement, shooting)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Asteroid.tscn/.gd       # Asteroid objects (RigidBody2D with physics)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Bullet.tscn/.gd         # Projectiles fired by player
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ UI.tscn/.gd            # Score display and game UI
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Background.tscn/.gd     # Starfield background with particles
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Explosion.tscn/.gd      # Particle effects for destroyed asteroids
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PauseMenu.tscn/.gd      # Pause menu (IN PROGRESS)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project.godot          # Project settings with input mappings
```

### Key Node Structure:
- **Main (Node)**: Root scene
  - **Player (CharacterBody2D)**: Player ship with collision and movement
  - **AsteroidContainer (Node2D)**: Container for spawned asteroids
  - **BulletContainer (Node2D)**: Container for bullets
  - **UI (Control)**: Score display
  - **Background (Node2D)**: Animated starfield
  - **PauseMenu (Control)**: Pause overlay (being added)

## Game Mechanics Implemented

### Player Controls:
- **Mouse**: Aim direction (ship rotates to face cursor)
- **WASD**: Directional movement (independent of rotation)
- **Left Mouse Click / Space / Enter**: Shoot bullets
- **ESC**: Pause menu (being implemented)

### Asteroid System:
- Asteroids spawn from screen edges every 1.0 seconds (decreasing over time)
- Random sizes and point values
- Physics-based movement toward screen center
- Fragment into smaller pieces when hit (implemented but may not be working)

### Shooting System:
- Bullets fire in the direction the ship is facing
- Limited fire rate with cooldown timer
- Bullets destroy on impact or screen exit

## Recent Changes Made

### Control System Overhaul:
1. **Mouse Aiming**: Ship now aims where mouse cursor points instead of keyboard rotation
2. **WASD Movement**: Changed from rotation-based to directional movement
3. **Input Actions**: Added "shoot" action for left mouse button

### Technical Fixes Applied:
1. **Container Fix**: Changed AsteroidContainer and BulletContainer from `Node` to `Node2D` (asteroids need 2D parent to render)
2. **Scene Loading**: Fixed asteroid and bullet scene instantiation
3. **Input Timing**: Changed from `is_action_pressed` to `is_action_just_pressed` for shooting
4. **Display Settings**: Added window stretch configuration for fullscreen support

### UI Changes:
- Removed all instruction text from game UI (as requested)
- Score display remains in top-left corner

## Debug Information

### Asteroid Spawning Debug Output:
The most recent debug confirms asteroids ARE being created:
```
DEBUG: Timer reached, spawning asteroid...
DEBUG: Attempting to spawn asteroid...
DEBUG: Asteroid instantiated: Asteroid:<RigidBody2D#34544289199>
DEBUG: Asteroid added to container. Container child count: 7
```

**This means the spawning logic is correct, but something is preventing visual rendering.**

## Current Pause Menu Implementation Status

### Completed:
- PauseMenu.tscn scene structure created
- PauseMenu.gd script with display options partially written
- Signal connections planned between Main and PauseMenu

### Still Needed:
1. **Finish PauseMenu script** - Add remaining pause functions to Main.gd
2. **Add PauseMenu to Main scene** - Instance the pause menu in Main.tscn
3. **ESC key mapping** - Ensure ui_cancel action triggers pause
4. **Pause state management** - Properly pause/resume game systems
5. **Process mode settings** - Set pause menu to process during pause

## Known Issues to Investigate

### Primary Issue: Asteroid Visibility
**Possible causes to check:**
1. **Z-index/layer ordering** - Asteroids might be behind background
2. **Camera viewport** - Asteroids spawning outside visible area
3. **Material/texture** - Asteroid sprite not loading properly
4. **Scale issues** - Asteroids too small to see
5. **Color/visibility** - Sprites might be transparent or same color as background

### Secondary Issues:
1. **Asteroid fragmentation** - May not be working correctly
2. **Collision detection** - Bullet-asteroid collision may need debugging
3. **Performance** - Many asteroids spawning but not being cleaned up

## Input Mappings (project.godot)
```
ui_accept: Space, Enter, Left Mouse Click
ui_cancel: Escape
ui_up/down/left/right: Arrow keys
shoot: Left Mouse Button (added)
```

## Tools and Commands Used
- **Godot MCP tools** for running/debugging project
- **Desktop Commander** for file editing
- Debug output to track asteroid spawning

## Next Steps for Continuation

### Immediate Priority:
1. **SOLVE ASTEROID VISIBILITY** - This is blocking gameplay
2. **Complete pause menu implementation**
3. **Test all game systems together**

### Investigation Approach for Asteroids:
1. Add debug prints to Asteroid.gd `_ready()` function to confirm asteroid setup
2. Check asteroid positioning values in spawn function
3. Verify asteroid sprite/texture loading
4. Test asteroid scale and z-index values
5. Temporarily increase asteroid size to see if they're just too small

### Pause Menu Completion:
1. Finish adding pause functions to Main.gd (toggle_pause, _on_resume_requested, _on_exit_requested)
2. Add PauseMenu instance to Main.tscn
3. Test ESC key functionality
4. Verify display mode changes work correctly

## Project Context
This game was created as a creative Godot 4 project in a fresh game directory. The user specifically requested mouse aiming, left-click shooting, WASD movement, and a pause menu system with display options - no ALT+ENTER fullscreen toggle.

The game is very close to being fully functional, with the asteroid visibility being the main blocking issue.
